          <p>
            I worked at Ö&B for three weeks during the summer break. I handled
            several tasks such as refilling the shelves and the store warehouse,
            both alone and alongside colleagues. I also helped out with removing
            the warehouse waste and answering customers' questions.

            I studied the technology programme at Wijkmanska specialising in
            industrial engineering. Here I got to write some desktop
            applications in Java, program both a circuit board and an industrial
            robot later on as part of projects and more.

            I studied full stack development specialising in .NET at Chas
            Academy in Stockholm. During my time there I learned to write in
            several languages such as C#, JavaScript and SQL. Furthermore, I
            have gained experience in Git, APIs, React, agile methodologies such
            as Scrum, TDD and more.
